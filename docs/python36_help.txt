OTA software requires python version 3.6 or newer. 


First - check your current python3 version. 
Command:  python3 --version


If you see python 3.5 or lower, check your currently installed OS version.
Command: cat /etc/os-release
You will see version name and number in a first line mainly.


If you see Raspbian Stretch (9) you have 3 options:

1. Compile newer python - hard, tedious and doesn't allways work

2. Burn SD-Card with newer OS version - simple, takes like 20 minutes
and would solve this and other problems quickly. 
Note: That would wipe your SD-Card content so remember about back-up
if you have something that you want to keep on it. 

How: Just google 'burning Raspberry SD card' etc :)

3. Changing apt sources to newer OS despite you use older OS - not elegant,
but works most of the time. Would take some time cause you have to download 
many megs of data and install it. Going that route should keep all your user
folder directory files in place. It can be also very benefitial when using boards
like Banana Pi etc. - those often doesn't offer newest Raspbian OS versions.

How - what commands to use*:
1. cd ~
2. sudo apt update
3. sudo apt upgrade -y
4. sudo reboot - you may reboot at this point but it is not required
5. cd ~ 
6. cd /etc/apt
7. sudo nano sources.list
8. change word "stretch" to "buster" (only that word, keep spaces etc in place)
9. save - Ctrl + S and than Ctrl + X
10. confirm changes with: cat /etc/apt/sources.list
11. cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
12. sudo nano raspi.list
13. change word "stretch" to "buster" (only that word, keep spaces etc in place)
14. save - Ctrl + S and than Ctrl + X
15. confirm changes with: cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list
16. cd ~
17. sudo apt update 
18. sudo apt upgrade -y
19. sudo apt update 
20. sudo apt dist-upgrade -y (note - it is not the same command as 2 points above)
21. sudo apt autoremove
22. sudo reboot - you may reboot at this point but it is not required

Now everything should work - you can check python3 version - as described 
at the top of this document 

* If you get some prompts during update etc. you have to answer accordingly. 
Please read asked question. You can probably anwer "no" or "keep the current version"
to most (or possibly all) of them. When asked about restarting services - choose "yes".
