OTA software requires python version 3.6 or newer. 


First - check your current python3 version. 
Command:  python3 -v
You will see in a wall-of-text lines like
"(...)/usr/lib/python3.5/(...)" etc.
Exit with: Ctrl + Z

If you see python 3.5 or lower, check your currently installes OS version.
Command: cat /etc/os-release
You will see version name and number in a first line mainly.


If you see Raspbian Stretch (9) you have 3 options:

1. Compile newer python - hard, tedious and doesn't allways work

2. Burn SD-Card with newer OS version - simple, takes like 20 minutes
and would solve this and other problems quickly. 
Note: That would wipe your SD-Card content so remember about back-up
if U have something that U want to keep on it. 

How: Just google 'burning Raspberry SD card' etc :)

3. Changing apt sources to newer OS despite U use older OS - not elegant,
but works most of the time. Would take some time cause U have to download 
few megs of data and install it. Going that route should keep all your user
folder directory files in place. 

How - what commands to use:
1. cd ~
2. sudo apt update
3. sudo apt upgrade -y
4. sudo reboot - you may reboot at this point but it is not required
5. cd ~ 
6. cd /etc/apt
7. sudo nano sources.list
8. change word "stretch" to "buster" (only that word, keep spaces etc in place)
9. save - Ctrl + S and than Ctrl + X
10. cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
11. sudo nano raspi.list
12. change word "stretch" to "buster" (only that word, keep spaces etc in place)
13. save - Ctrl + S and than Ctrl + X
14. cd ~
15. sudo apt update 
16. sudo apt upgrade -y
17. sudo reboot - you may reboot at this point but it is not required
18. now everything should work - you can check python3 version - as described 
at the top of this document
