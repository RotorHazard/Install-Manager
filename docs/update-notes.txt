        UPDATE NOTES:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^


2.2.10beta0
Code mostly ready

BETA - in constant development
look into commits for updates history


2.2.10beta0

Code mostly cleaned
OTA converted to python3
Opening script implemented
Link to Facebook group added to readme


_________________________________________________________________

2.2.9n

Small fixes
New branches naming scheme with according 
changes in files
Indication of last stable release with python 2 support


2.2.9m

Added logging with an option of uploading results
to the developer + developer tools for downloading
Raspberry Pi 4 friendly configuration


2.2.9l

Added ConfigParser features instead of hidden files
Auto conversion from previous approach

Just in case:
Important: if after performing an update you saw
that config file (not json) in directory:
'~/.ota_markers/ota_config.txt' is empty and you find
occasional errors during normal using of the software 
just remove that file entirely:
' rm ~/.ota_markers/ota_config.txt '
and than just open OTA again.
You can input config values manually in this file 
- just once, if you want to be well organised :)

Options: 1 means "true"

2.2.5 and higher

If you performed an update from 2.2.4 version or previous 
and you want to use custom pins as reset pins:

Change line in updater-config.json file so it looks like:

    "pins_assignment" : "custom"

So the file looks like this:

{
    "pi_user" : (...),
    "RH_version" : (...),
    "debug_user" : (...),
    "country" : (...),
    "nodes_number" : (...),
    "debug_mode" : 0,
    "pins_assignment" : "custom"
}

And than edit lines 60 to 67 in nodes_update.py file.

nano nodes_update.py

Happy flyin'!
