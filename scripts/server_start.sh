LOOKS LIKE ERROR OCCURRED

You may want to try:
- manually enable I2C interface with 'sudo raspi-config'
- manually change RH directory permissions with 'sudo chmod -R 777 ~/RotorHazard'
- if you see 'sqlalchemy.exc.OperiationalError' you may try to remove old 'database.db'
file from '~/RotorHazard/src/server/' directory and attempt to restart the server then

-- If you just stopped the server with a keyboard (Ctrl+C) - ignore that message --

  read -p "Hit Enter to exit now " var

echo "You can stop the server by pressing Ctrl+C "
printf "Server booting, please wait"
