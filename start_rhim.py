Program has detected that you are using python version 3.5 or lower.
This software requires python 3.6 or higher. You can manually update apt sources
for your OS - that process is described with details in the file
'~/RH_Install-Manager/docs/python36help.txt' - check here or on the GitHub repo page.

You could also just burn SD-Card with Raspbian Buster (10) or newer since those
support python 3.6+ natively. Using newer OS is advised anyways.

To check currently used Raspbian OS version - type: 'cat /etc/os-release'
To check currently used python3 version - type: 'python3 --version'
To list all python versions installed on your OS - type: 'python' and hit Tab twice

Detailed instructions what to do now can be found in: RH_Install-Manager/docs/python36_help.txt
