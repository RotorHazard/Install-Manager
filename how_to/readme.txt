"hw_mod_instructions.txt" file is for people that would like to make a mod that allows to make "nodes firmware update"
on existing "Delta5" PCBs. No need to perform those if you use official RotorHazard PCBs.

Included PDF is just for some reference. Some photos maybe useful. Generally - it is obsolete, but there is some
amount of "history" of that project :)
