"hw_mod_instructions.txt" file is for people that would like to make a mod that allows to make "nodes firmware update"
on existing "Delta5" PCBs. No need to perform those if U use official RotorHazard PCBs.

Included PDF is just for a future reference. Some photos maybe useful. Generally - is is obsolete, but there is some
amount of "history" of that project :)
