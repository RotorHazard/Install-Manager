Welcome to OTA! With this software you can easily install, update and manage your RotorHazard installation. You can also flash the newest firmware onto Arduino nodes without opening the timer again. Please configure OTA using a wizard after reading that message. After that you will be asked about configuring the system. Please do it, if you haven’t done it manually already. Interfaces like: UART, SPI, I2C and SSH will be enabled. You can always open this message in Main Menu - point 5. ￼

You may also be interested in features like automatic hotpost configuration or adding aliases to your system.


Wish you good experience.
