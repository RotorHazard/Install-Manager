We want to make a file structure with i2c_nodes_flash in main directory with menu etc.

In node_flashing_resources there would be:
file named flash_common.py - with functions that would be used in every file in that directory
8 files for flashing 8 nodes - yes, evey node HAS TO have own file. Weird. It has something to do
with initializing i2c communication etc. This is walkaround. Not most elegant but also not the worst.
Proved to be working. So basically there has to be one file that calls module after module. Simple.
Last thing to be testes - if every module like flash_node_1, flash_node_2 etc needs to import smbus etc
or cat in be just a "function caller" - from a flash_common module. Either way most of the code will be
in flash_common and i2c_nodes_flash would contain menu and right call.
