If you want to flash custom firmware, put it into this folder in format presented below.

'custom_node.hex'

Remember to use files that contain bootloader. In Arduino IDE you have to:
'Tools' -> 'Board' -> 'Arduino Nano'
and
'Tools' -> 'Processor' -> 'ATmega328P (old bootloader)'

Next:
'Sketch' -> 'Export compiled Binary' -> 'Show Sketch Folder' (after successful compiling)

Next - find a file named like 'my_file.ino.with_bootloader.eightanaloginputs.hex'.
Change its name to 'custom_node.hex'. Next place that file (using scp, winscp etc.)
in '~/RH-ota/firmware/custom_firmware/' in the Raspbian OS on the Pi.

Next - open OTA software as usual, enter Nodes Flashing in Main Menu and navigate
to 'Flash custom firmware'. Use integrated steps to flash the firmware.
